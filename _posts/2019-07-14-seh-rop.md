this is the continuation of R 3.4.4 - Buffer Overflow (SEH) ,but this time we are going to cover seh based rop chain. after this is a continuation. we are going to skip some few things
====================

to bypass DEP (prevention of data execution), We will need some things to build our rop chain for the SEH vulnerability and execute our code successfully

* Pop pop ret not Possible
* Code execution on stack failed
* Rop chain
* Bypass execution prevention
* Way to return to our payload

I will show you in this simple image how our payload will look like

after we setup our stack pivot , traditional rop chain setup, and shellcode against our target as below 

![rop_chain](/static/img/04/rop_chain.png)


We have been able to execute mock shellcode , but we can change it by any other shellcode like `reverse shell, calculators or even more malicious download - execute malware` , but those things are out of topic here.
